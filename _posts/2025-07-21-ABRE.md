## Abstract

**Background**: Genetic variation regulates the abundance of bacteria from the upper airway microbiome linked to asthma exacerbations [1]. However, the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) remains unclear. We aimed to identify leukocyte epigenetic markers associated with upper airway bacterial genera involved in asthma exacerbations.

**Methods**: The pharyngeal and nasal microbiome were analyzed in up to 176 Canary Islanders with asthma by 16S rRNA (V3-V4 regions) sequencing. The blood epigenome was analyzed using the Illumina EPICv1 array. Associations between 709,923 CpGs and microbiome traits were examined through epigenome-wide testing adjusted for age, sex, ancestry, and cell heterogeneity. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified and subjected to enrichment analysis. Multiple testing was adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.1.

**Results**: DNAm at six CpG sites, involving the genes *GRIN2D*, *TCF4*, *LRRC4C*, *UGDH*, and *ZNF331*, were significantly associated with pharyngeal *Campylobacter* abundance (*p*<5x10<sup>-7</sup>) and one CpG (*LOC101927284*) was significantly associated with nasal *Dolosigranulum* abundance (*p*=8.9x10<sup>-8</sup>). 249 and 336 DMRs were associated with exacerbation-related pharyngeal and nasal bacterial genera, respectively, previously identified in this cohort [2]. DMRs were enriched in genes involved in lung inflammation (adjusted *p*=0.07), and DNA transcription regulation (adjusted *p*=3.69x10<sup>-6</sup>).

**Conclusion**: We reported novel associations between leukocyte methylation at DNA regulatory transcription loci and pulmonary inflammation-related genes and the upper airway microbiome involved in asthma exacerbations. These findings highlight the potential of epigenetic regulation as a mediator of host–microbiome crosstalk in asthma pathogenesis.
